bloom filter must to watch youtube videos:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjpXRtXfN1I
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4wBwJF88O8 (4 parts)

how to execute the job:
1. run the Training.java class with these args:
args[0] hot_values -> input file, the 'hot values' directory.
args[1] 2 -> the number of records we will use with the trained filter (Comments.xml).
args[2] 0.01 -> the desired false positive rate.
args[3] /out -> output file, the bloom filter object.

files for example:

hot_values/hot-values.txt:
beer
banana

then run the Driver.java class which is the job that uses the trained filter.
we had the word "beer" as a member of the 'hot-values.txt' set and
we have "beer" in the second record as part of the 'Text' attribute.
we expect to "catch" the second record using the trained bloom filter.
