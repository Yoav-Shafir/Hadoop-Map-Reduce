This example illustrates how to use customized partitioner in a MapReduce program.
We will use custom partitioning in MapReduce program to find the maximum scorer in each gender 
and three age categories: less than 20, 20 to 50, greater than 50.

run job on the 'dataset/data/scorer.txt' file.

the output will be:

/out/part-r-00000:
Nancy	age- 7	female	score-98
Adam	age- 9	male	score-37

/out/part-r-00001:
Kristine	age- 38	female	score-53
Bob	age- 34	male	score-89

/out/part-r-00002:
Monica	age- 56	female	score-92
Chris	age- 67	male	score-97
