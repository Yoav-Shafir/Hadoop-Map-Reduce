Transform your row-based data to a hierarchical format, such as JSON or XML.
Given a list of posts and comments, we'll create a structured XML hierarchy to nest
comments with their related post.

run the on on the Posts.xml & Comments.xml files.

Posts.xml:
here we have a post record with an Id of 1.

<row Id="1" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="35" CreationDate="2014-01-21T21:07:40.557" 
Score="4" Body="Some beer use..." href="" OwnerUserId="27" LastActivityDate="2014-01-21T21:07:40.557" CommentCount="0" />

Comments.xml
here we have 2 comments with a PostId of 1 which is like a foreign key to the post record.

<row Id="1" PostId="1" Score="0" Text="This is a matter of taste I guess." CreationDate="2014-01-21T20:34:28.740" UserId="10" />
<row Id="8" PostId="1" Score="5" Text="A good answer here should include *how* various types of glasses work." CreationDate="2014-01-21T20:34:28.740" UserId="39" />

expected result:

<post Body="Some beer use..." CommentCount="0" CreationDate="2014-01-21T21:07:40.557" Id="1" LastActivityDate="2014-01-21T21:07:40.557" OwnerUserId="27" ParentId="35" PostTypeId="2" Score="4" href="">
	<comments CreationDate="2014-01-21T20:34:28.740" Id="8" PostId="1" Score="5" Text="A good answer here should include *how* various types of glasses work." UserId="39"/>
	<comments CreationDate="2014-01-21T20:34:28.740" Id="1" PostId="1" Score="0" Text="This is a matter of taste I guess." UserId="10"/>
